# create a data store for IPFS
mkdir ipfs && cd $_

# adds a regular file to ipfs. this will add your file to ipfs and return its multihash handle
echo "bla bla bla" >> bla.txt  && cat $_
ipfs add bla.txt
# this will return a multihash for your file 

# TIP
ipfs is content hashed. so if you have a file that has content "bla bla bla" then it will have the exact same multihash 
as my file above.

# add your computer to ipfs network
