ipfs is content hashed. so if you have a file that has content "bla bla bla" then it will have the exact same multihash 
as my file above.

# observations
1.
when i add a new file to ipfs i can see it at following address even though my system is behind a nat
https://gateway.ipfs.io/ipfs/<multihash for your file>
it does need the api to be running at localhost:5001
this means that ipfs is using the api to convey this information to ipfs network.

2.
initially i am able to add any files to ipfs even if i don;t start the daemon
however, if i start and then stop the daemon then i can't add files to ipfs
it complains about api being down
why?

3.
localhost:5001/webui eventually shows me that i am connect to so many peers
how?
i am behind NAT without any port forwarding
